# application_modeling_2.0



This repository is a second attempt to my project, modeling a php appication to analyse potential impact of a modification.
It is the evolution of the first attempt : repository application_modeling.

- subject.odt describes how the compagny works, explain the project, its goals, the way it has to work, the tools used, the limits, the prerequisites, etc.

- TODO explains and divides in small steps the development of the big steps of the section REALISATION of subject.odt.

- requirements lists php extensions and libraries you have to install to run the programm, and explains how to install them.



HOW TO USE : 

First of all, yo need to have an active and reachable neo4j database.

In index.php, in section initialisation, complete values of variable $repoToTest with the absolute path to the repository you want to model, and complete values of databases variables to be enable the programm to connect to it.

Then just execute the programm, and checkout your database !
